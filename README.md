# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview
There are thousands of species of bacteria living in belly buttons and no two bellybuttons are a like when it comes to population or which species are excisting in a belly button. Also, certain bacteria have proved to be useful and in one case is to synthesize meat. So, people had their belly buttons cultured to see what bacteria they have in thier own as well as document their demographics for data collection. I have been asked to create a dashboard that would be user friendly with a drop down menu and visual tools to quickly get the desired results to populate.

## Summary
The dashboard successfully adjusts to the selection chosen in the drop-down menu making it easy for anyone to use this site. When an ID is chosen the bar chart shows the ten most common bacteria found in the culture collected for that ID. Also, the demographics listed for that ID is populated under the drop down menu. A bubble chart shows all bacteria found and the bubbles are size according to the amount found. A final visual tool was added as a gauge to show how often the person with each ID claimed to wash their belly buttons per week. Lastly, a paragraph was added to give a brief background and to balance out the charts and gauges to make it visually appealing. Also, a calm color scheme related to belly buttons was added for the background as well as the title and banner image to give the user an instant idea of the topic of the page.
